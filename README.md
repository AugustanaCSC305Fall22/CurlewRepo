ABOUT:

The Gameboard Editor program was designed to create 3 dimensional gameboards for table-top RPG game.
The program allows a user to edit and export the map in .obj file so it is 3d printable.

Menus:

The user can start creating a map by choosing among 5 given menus, which are using premade templates, starting from scratch, loading existing file, generating random map, or generating a maze.
Users are given with the choice of what shape of tiles that they want to use (either hexagon or square). 

Features:

For editing part of the map, a lot of advanced features are given.
First, Users will be able to select multiple tiles at the same time to edit.
Most basic one is a feature where a user can increase/decrease the height of the tiles through several ways (e.i. raise, lower, tile elevation legends).
Also, landform features are given.
There are 5 different landforms that are already given by a program (mountain, volcano, trench, valley, gate to hell).
Furthermore, a user can set a scale of the features with scale slider. Users can add those features at a wanted tile.
The program also provides multiple useful tools in editing which are undo, redo, copy, paste, clear, and move.
More advanced tool, "add/delete row/column" allows users to resize the map while editing.
Users are also allowed to select all the tiles that are at the same height and edit all those tiles simultaneously.
For one of the most advanced feature, users will be able to switch the style of tiles while editing.
Also, users can also save the map that they created/edited as a template if they'd like to keep it.
Users will be able to delete the maps that they have set as templates but not the given ones.
Users will be able to preview the RPG map that they created in 3D prior to exporting.

For those users who are not familiar with the program, we have several information about the application under "help" menu. 
Users can even access the tutorial video, where it explains how to use the application.

Known Issues:

This program has a save-handling feature where it asks the user if they want to save the file before exiting the page or the application, if they haven't saved the project or the changes made in the project. However, once users enter an map editing window, even though the map hasn't had any changes from the template or a scratch, if the user tries to exit the window or an application, the program will still ask the user if they wanted to save the changes.
Also, once users delete the templates they added, they will not be able to restore the deleted templates.
Lastly, this program will not automatically resize or reposition the components accordingly when the size of the window is increased.
