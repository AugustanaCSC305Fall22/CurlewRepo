Version 1.0 Release Notes

Team Curlew's 3-D Tabletop RPG Game Board Editor
This program was made for CSC 305 Software Development class at Augustana College
The Gameboard Editor program was designed to create 3 dimensional gameboards for table-top RPG game.
The program allows a user to edit and export the map in .obj file so it is 3d printable.
The user can start creating a map by choosing among 5 given menus, which are using premade templates, starting from scratch, loading existing file, generating random map, or generating a maze
A user is given with the choice of what shape of tiles that users want to use (either hexagon or square). User is also allowed to change the style of tiles while in editing phase.
For editing the map, a lot of advanced features are given.
Most basically, a program has a feature where a user can increase/decrease the height of the tiles through several ways (e.i. raise, lower, tile elevation legends)
Also, landform features are given
There are 5 different landforms features that are already given by a program (mountain, volcano, trench, valley, gate to hell). 
Scale of the features can be modified by scale slider.
Users can add those features at a wanted tile.
The program also provides multiple useful tools in editing which are undo, redo, copy, paste, and move.
Another our advanced tool "add/delete-row/column" allows users to resize the map while editing. 
For more advanced features, users can also save the map that they created/edited as a template if they'd like to keep it.
Users will be able to preview the RPG map that they created in 3D prior to exporting.
For those users who are not familiar with the program, we have several information about the application under "help" menu. 
Users can even access the tutorial video, where it explains how to use the application.
