Team Curlew's 3-D Tabletop RPG Game Board Editor
This program was made for CSC 305 Software Development class at Augustana College
The Gameboard Editor program was designed to create 3 dimentional gameboards for roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons or Pathfinder
The maps support 3d printing, and can be previewed in 3d
The user can create maps using premade templates, start from scratch, generate randomly, or generate a maze
The styles allow for square tiles and hexagon tiles, and can be changed during editing
There are landforms features that can be added during editing as well
